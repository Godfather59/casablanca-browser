## Usage statistics collection in Casablanca

By default, Casablanca sends some statistics about how it's used. Currently, these include:

* Your operating system and computer language
* When you installed Casablanca
* The version of Casablanca that you're using
* How often you use certain features in Casablanca
* An anonymous ID representing your installation of Casablanca

Collecting this data allows us to prioritize which devices and operating systems we test and which features we work on.

Casablanca does not send:
* Anything that can be used to personally identify you
* Any browsing history, passwords, or other data stored locally in Casablanca

If you want to opt-out of statistics collection, you can do so by going to the preferences page within Casablanca and de-selecting "send usage statistics".
